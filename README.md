# Hey, I'm Kristupas 👋  

## 🚀 Digital Marketing Specialist | SEO Enthusiast | Data-Driven Strategist  

I thrive at the intersection of creativity and analytics, crafting digital marketing strategies that don’t just attract traffic but turn visitors into loyal customers. From SEO and content marketing to performance analysis, I love uncovering data-driven insights that drive real results.  

When I'm not optimizing campaigns or fine-tuning digital strategies, you’ll probably find me staying active—whether it’s hitting the gym, exploring the outdoors, or pushing my limits in a new sport. An active lifestyle keeps me focused, energized, and always ready for the next challenge.
